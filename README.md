# 🧠 AI Research & Security Engineering: AI Fundamentals & Adversarial Analysis

A technical repository documenting applied research, threat vectors, model alignment, and hands-on lab implementations across foundational machine learning and modern Large Language Model (LLM) architectures.

---

## 📌 Mission & Research Focus

As machine learning systems transition from static, isolated classifiers into autonomous agents integrated into enterprise systems, securing the boundary between probabilistic outputs and deterministic code becomes critical.

This repository tracks research across the **AI Fundamentals** phase of the AI Security pathway, evaluating how core model mechanics dictate system vulnerability profiles:
* **Taxonomy & Architecture:** Mathematical feedback loops, deep neural networks, and self-attention transformers.
* **Adversarial Exploitation:** Direct and indirect prompt injection, data poisoning, model inversion, and evasion.
* **Data Integrity & Lineage:** Supply chain security, training set integrity, and embedding space dynamics.
* **Defensive Engineering & Alignment:** RLHF calibration, guardrail models, and digital forensics in AI environments (AI DFIR).
